# Maze Generation and Pathfinding in C++

This is a sideproject which I'm working on as of March 25th 2021, it started as a challenge from one of my TA's in an electronics course and ended up as a bit of a passion project. This is my attempt at learning C++ on my own with a project I actually enjoy!

## Built for speed

When I think of C++ I think of Object Oriented Speed, and that's what this project is all about. I'm trying my best to make this as fast as possible while still being readable, with exception of the bitmap generation. I'm trying to let this be a *very* crude benchmark for the maze generation and pathfinding algorithms there are.
